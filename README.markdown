Rake tasks to run specs in parallel, to use multiple CPUs and speedup test runtime.

NOTE: This is a clone of http://github.com/grosser/parallel_specs

Setup
=====

    script/plugin install git://github.com/joakimk/parallel_specs.git

Add <%= ENV['TEST_ENV_NUMBER'] %> to the database name for the test environment in `config/database.yml`,  
it is '' for process 1, and '2' for process 2.

    test:
      adapter: mysql
      database: xxx_test<%= ENV['TEST_ENV_NUMBER'] %>
      username: root

For each environment, create the databases
    mysql -u root -> create database xxx_test2;

Run like hell :D  

    rake spec:parallel:prepare[2] #db:reset for each database

    rake spec:parallel[1] --> 86 seconds
    rake spec:parallel    --> 47 seconds (default = 2)
    rake spec:parallel[4] --> 26 seconds
    ...

Example output
--------------
    2 processes: 209 specs (105 specs per process)
    ... test output ...
    Took 47.319378 seconds

TIPS
====
 - `./script/generate rspec` if you are running rspec from gems (this plugin uses script/spec which may fail if rspec files are outdated)
 - with zsh this would be `rake "spec:parallel:prepare[3]"`

TODO
====
 - find out how many CPUs the user has [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/891537/ruby-detect-number-of-cpus-installed)
 - sync the output, so that results do not appear all at once
 - grab the 'xxx examples ..' line and display them at the bottom
 - somehow make the test load equal so that the process end at the same time. perhaps by using profiling data from previous runs somehow?
